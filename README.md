1. How does programming on embedded systems compare to programming
on desktop computers? Here are some points to consider?(Reference  page 150 of "Exploring BeagleBone")

    1. Always write the clearest and cleanest code.
    2. Don't optimaize your code until it is complete.
    3. Know of how you are consuming resources than when programming: the size of data types, passing data correctly,memmory availability, file system size, and data commitication availability.
    4. Lear about the underlying hardware platform. How dose it handle the connected hardware? Data buses are availabe? Interface with operating system and low-level librarise? Real-time constraints?

2. Scripting Language
   1. Bash scripting
   2. Perl
   3. Python

3.  Multi-cal Binary(Reference page 187 of "Exploring BeagleBone")
4.  OOP in C++
    1.  Class and Object: 
        1.  A Class is a description: state( or data) and methods( or behavior).
        2.  An object is the realization of the class description - an instance of class.
    2.  Encapsulation is used to hide the mechanics of a object.
    3.  Inheritance  is a feature of OOP the enables building class descriptions from other class description.
5.  Linux boot process
6.  Linux Device Tree
7.  Function pointer
